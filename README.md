# Missing Survey Data Talk 
In this talk, we introduced a Bayesian nonparametric method that utilizes design information in survey weights to handle missing survey data problems. Our approach can account for skewed and irregular distributions and satisfy predetermined edit constraints. The proposed method has been further extended to account for calibration constraints in the imputation process.
